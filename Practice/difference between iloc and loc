The main distinction between loc and iloc is: 
loc is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels.
iloc is integer position-based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer position values (0-based integer position)


loc() : loc() is label based data selecting method which means that we have to pass the name of the row or column which we want to select. 
This method includes the last element of the range passed in it.
loc() can accept the boolean data unlike iloc() .

The main distinction between the two methods is:

loc gets rows (and/or columns) with particular labels.

iloc gets rows (and/or columns) at integer locations.
